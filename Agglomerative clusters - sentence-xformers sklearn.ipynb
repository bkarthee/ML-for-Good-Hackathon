That could prevent that and that's scary because moving forward from this I think that's this thing's could only things can get much worse going forward and I think that the entrenchment of capital and of money to interest will continue and what will consolidate even further as a result of this and if it does then it's going to be even harder to break through that but we're able to to move past that into to wake up and establish a collective conscience and among working people and I think that we can make it through this\n",
